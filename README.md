As a die-hard fan of CakePHP who's been 'baking' for years, I couldn't help but feel a bit... crusty when switching to NestJS. Sure, NestJS is awesome, but where's my beloved `bake` command? So, I did what any reasonable developer would do: I created Baker!

Baker is like that friend who shows up at your house with all the ingredients and starts whipping up a gourmet meal while you're still trying to figure out how to boil water. It's a powerful CLI tool designed to streamline the process of generating NestJS API components from your existing database schema. It automatically creates entities, DTOs, controllers, and services, saving you valuable development time. 

Think of it as `bake` command's cool, TypeScript-loving cousin. It's here to make your NestJS development process a piece of cake... or should I say, a slice of nest?

## Features

- 🗃️ Analyzes your existing database schema faster than you can say "schema"
- 🏗️ Generates NestJS entities that would make even the most seasoned architects jealous
- 🛠️ Creates DTOs (Data Transfer Objects) because, let's face it, who has time to manually transfer data anymore?
- 🎮 Builds controllers with CRUD operations so smooth, they're basically the butter cream of your API layer
- 🔧 Produces services with basic CRUD functionality - it's like a Swiss Army knife, but for your database
- 📊 Provides a clear summary of your database schema, because sometimes we all need a little reminder of what we've created
- 🏗️ Generates Vue.js dashboard from an exisitng database or nestjs project (BETA)
